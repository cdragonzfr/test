* Researchers had 10 real-world cybersecurity pros (like red teamers and pentesters) simulate hacking into a network using a tool called **Bloodhound** (used to map out paths in a company’s network).
* First, participants were told nothing about traps.
* Then, halfway through, they were told, “There are deception traps in this network. If you trigger one, you’ll get caught.”

They observed how this changed the attackers' behavior.

### 📊 **Key Findings**

1. **Attackers got nervous.**

   * Just *knowing* about traps made them anxious and more cautious.
   * Some wanted to give up or find easier targets.

2. **Attack paths became longer.**

   * After the warning, attackers took longer, more complicated paths.
   * They avoided anything that looked “too good to be true” (like a super-easy admin account).

   > “If it looks too good to be true, it probably is a trap.”

3. **Some attackers couldn’t even continue.**

   * 4 out of 10 participants couldn’t find a second path once they were told about the traps — decision paralysis set in.

4. **Decoys don’t always need to be hidden.**

   * Obvious decoys can still be useful — they either scare off attackers or act as bait.
   * Think of a cheese trap that says “Free Cheese” — some mice still try it.

5. **Even talking about deception works.**

   * Posting on LinkedIn that your company uses deception can make attackers more cautious — before they even touch the network.

6. **Attackers research you.**

   * They’ll check employee profiles, job listings, and tech stack to assess how likely it is that traps exist.

### 📌 Takeaway for Cyber Defenders

* **Just *announcing* you use deception may deter attackers** — even if you haven’t set up the traps yet.
* **Attackers are human too** — they have fears, assumptions, and limited time.
* **Overt deception tactics** can create hesitation, confusion, or even make them walk away.
* **Deception can mess with their decision-making**, and that’s a win.
